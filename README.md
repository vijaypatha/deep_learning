# deep_learning
This repo is dedicated to documenting my learning in deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML).

My Approch:
1) I'm a cook. I really dont care about wiring of the appliance of the hi-tech kitchen. 

2) I'm aware that I will never be 100% perfect in python, nor do i have desire to get there. Web provides most of the recieps for syntax. My focus is on developing thought process in bringing intelligence. With reagards to "pythonic", for me "good enough" will do the job. 

3) I'm a Product Manager. I'm more intrested to slove real business problems using DL and ML as a tool. I want to effectively communicate with Data and Applied Scientists.
